# NetworkEpidemics
A Julia package for simulating epidemics on various network models.

This currently includes simulation of SI, SIS and SIR dynamics on Metapopulation, Contact Processes and a brand new model named Metaplex (name may be subject to change).

Each model can be simulated using either a generic Gillespie algorithm or by integrating meanfield equations.
